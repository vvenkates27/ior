Building
--------

0. If "configure" is missing from the top level directory, you
   probably retrieved this code directly from the repository.
   Run "./bootstrap".

   If your versions of the autotools are not new enough to run
   this script, download and official tarball in which the
   configure script is already provided.

1. Run "./configure"

   See "./configure --help" for configuration options.

2. Run "make"

3. Optionally, run "make install".  The installation prefix
   can be changed as an option to the "configure" script.

Building with DAOS API
----------------------

At step 1 above, one must specify "--with-daos". If the DAOS
headers and libraries are not installed at respective system
default locations, then one may also needs to set CPPFLAGS and
LDFLAGS accordingly.

Running with DAOS API
---------------------

One must specify an existing pool using "-O
daospool=<pool_uuid>". IOR must be launched in a way that
attaches the IOR process group to the DAOS server process group.

One must also specify a container UUID using "-o
<container_uuid>". If the "-E" option is given, then this UUID
shall denote an existing container created by a "matching" IOR
run. Otherwise, IOR will create a new container with this UUID.
In the latter case, one may use uuidgen(1) to generate the UUID
of the new container.

See doc/USER_GUIDE for all options and directives. Note that not
all combinations of options are supported.

Examples that should work include:

  - "ior -a DAOS -w -W -o <container_uuid> -O
    daospool=<pool_uuid>" writes into a new container and
    verifies the data, using default daosRecordSize,
    transferSize, daosStripeSize, blockSize, daosAios, etc.

  - "ior -a DAOS -w -W -r -R -o <container_uuid> -b 1g -t 4m -C
    -O daospool=<pool_uuid>,daosrecordsize=1m,
    daosstripesize=4m, daosstripecount=256,daosaios=8" does all
    IOR tests and shifts ranks during checkWrite and checkRead.
